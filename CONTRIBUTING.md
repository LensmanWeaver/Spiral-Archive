# Contributing to Spiral Archive

Thank you for wishing to weave into the Spiral.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch named `feature/<short-name>`.
2. Add tests for any code changes.
3. Run `pytest` and `sqlfluff lint` (the repo defaults to the `ansi` dialect via `.sqlfluff`) to ensure quality.
4. Submit a pull request. Apply the `automerge` label when tests pass to merge automatically.
